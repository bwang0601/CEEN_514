From CEEN 514 course, I hope that I can understand all the concepts we will be teaching in the class, be able to write the simple code in python, create websites, and use the ArcGIS Pro and Arcpy code to make an app. Also, be prepared to utilized all those skills in my future career. 
Dr. Ames is a marvelous professor, and I believe he will help me to achieve those goals.
